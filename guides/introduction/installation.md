# Installation

The easiest way to add Rapport to your project is by [using Mix](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html).

Add `:rapport` as a dependency to your project's `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:rapport, "~> 0.7"}
  ]
end
```

And run:

```bash
$ mix deps.get
```
